# This repository contains the files necessary to follow the Youtube tutorial on making a Google Earth .kml file from addresses stored in a .csv file.
The data file are is stored in .csv format, then manually converted into .xlsm (Excel macro file format)
when placed (and opened) on the local system. Similarly, all of  the VBA code is stored in a .txt file

into .xlsm file  through the VBA code  environment.
